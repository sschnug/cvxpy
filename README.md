CVXPY is a Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems. It allows you to express your problem in a natural way that follows the math, rather than in the restrictive standard form required by solvers.

CVXPY was designed and implemented by Steven Diamond, with input from Stephen Boyd and Eric Chu.
